					<h2 class="text-heading">Background:</h2>
					<p>Galileo is most widely known as the man who defied the Catholic Church and reaffirmed Nicolaus Copernicus’ theory of heliocentrism, which states that Earth and other planets orbit the Sun.</p>
					<p>However, throughout his life, Galileo contributed fundamental shifts to the sciences of physics, astronomy, mathematics, and engineering. Many of his inventions are still used today like the thermometer, telescope, and the geometric compass.</p>
					<p>His accomplishments certainly left a lasting legacy and helped advance future findings, like his principle of relativity that provided a framework for Newton’s laws of motion.</p>
					<p>Galileo also advanced the scientific method instead of following the traditional, scientific practices of the Church. He was one of the first intellectuals to believe that the laws of nature are mathematical, leading to experimentation as a recognized method for understanding philosophy and science.</p>
					<p>His legacy is best described by Stephen Hawking who said, “Galileo probably bears more of the responsibility for the birth of modern science than anybody else.”</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Proposed the theory of uniform acceleration, stating that a falling body would fall at the same acceleration as long as the resistance of the medium through which it was falling remained negligible. This theory was later incorporated into Newton’s first law of motion. Galileo confirmed his theory by dropping two weights from the top of the Leaning Tower of Pisa and observing that they both landed at the same time. This experiment disproved Aristotle’s long-held claim that the speed of a fall of a heavy object is proportional to its weight.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Discovered that projectiles carried by a uniform horizontal motion follow a parabolic trajectory in the absence of air resistance. This finding, coupled with his theory of uniform acceleration provided the initial science of gravity.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Observed multiple deformations of the universe, including that of the Moon and the Sun, which countered the traditional view that the heavens were untouched and pure. He found that the surface of Earth’s Moon is not as smooth as believed, but rather rough and uneven and that the Sun contained a series of dark sunspots. He also found the Milky Way to be a compact set of stars instead of a nebulous entity.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Most notably, he confirmed the Copernican theory of an helio-centric universe by discovering the orbits of planets like Jupiter and Venus and its moons. Upon observing the changing nature of its orbital phases, Galileo concluded that the planets must revolve around the Sun. This fundamentally challenged the Aristotelian cosmology principle that all heavenly bodies circled the Earth, a view that the Catholic Church strongly supported.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Improved the engineering of the telescope ten-fold advancing the magnification from a standard 3x to 30x. Using trial and error, he reverse-engineered existing technology to create a telescope capable of seeing distant stars and planets.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Devised and improved a geometric compass, which served useful for military and surveying applications.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Constructed a thermometer using the expansion and contraction of air in a bulb to move water in a tube.</p>
						</li>
